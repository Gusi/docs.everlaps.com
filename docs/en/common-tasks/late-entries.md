## &fa-user; Late entries

In Everlaps it is very easy to modify registrations and or series without having to re-generate the existing distribution.

### Driver registration after series and heats have been generated

When a driver arrives late and the race has already started, the addition is easily possible without having to re-generate the series and heats.

1. If the driver does not exist in the database, a registry is made in the [drivers list](../user-guide/drivers.md).
2. The race is selected [race](../user-guide/races.md) in which the driver wishes to be registered.
3. Th driver is found in the [available drivers list](../user-guide/races.md#pilotos-disponibles).
4. The driver is [registered](../user-guide/races.md#inscripciones) in the race.
5. Go to tab [series](../user-guide/races.md#series) and choose the session where the driver is to be added.
6. Find the driver in the panel [drivers without a series](../user-guide/races.md#pilotos-sin-serie).
7. Drag and drop the driver into the series that is desired, as long as it is not the series of the active heat.
8. If various drivers need to be registered, a **new series** can be generated and all the drivers can be drag and dropped into it. Next the *Confirm* button will need to be pressed to generate the heats corresponding to the new series.

### Deleting drivers that will not be participating in the session or race 

Once the series are generated, it is possible to remove drivers (drag dropping into the [drivers without a series](../user-guide/races.md#pilotos-sin-serie) panel) as long as no results exist for none of the heats belonging to that series.

Similarly, if de-registering a driver from the race is desired, the registration can be deleted as long as the driver does not belong to any series among the sessions of the race.

If a driver is registered in a heat that has already been run, but it is desired that the driver no longer participates in the following sessions, the driver can be marked as *excluded* in the [registrations list](../user-guide/races.md#inscripciones).
